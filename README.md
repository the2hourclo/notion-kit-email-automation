   - Email is scheduled in Kit for your Publish Date

---

### Test Before Sending to Everyone

**Always test first!**

#### Test Mode (Recommended for First Run)

1. **Enable Test Mode:**
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Secrets
   - Set `TEST_MODE=true` and `TEST_EMAIL=your@email.com`

2. **Create Test Email:**
   - Name: "TEST - First Email"
   - SL1: "Testing automation"
   - Publish Date: Set to 5 minutes from now (MUST be future date!)
   - Segments: Test (or any segment)
   - Status: Ready to Send

3. **Run Workflow:**
   - GitHub → Actions → "Send Emails from Notion to Kit"
   - Click "Run workflow"

4. **Verify:**
   - Check your test email inbox
   - Verify images display correctly
   - Verify Notion updated to "Scheduled & Sent"

5. **Disable Test Mode:**
   - Set `TEST_MODE=false` in GitHub Secrets
   - Now emails will send to actual segments

#### Quick Test (Using Kit Segments)

1. Set Segments = "Test" (must match a Kit segment/tag name)
2. Set Status = "Ready to Send"
3. Set Publish Date to future date
4. Trigger workflow
5. Check your test email inbox
6. Once verified, duplicate email, set Segments = "Everyone", send again

---

### View Email Stats

**Stats sync automatically daily at 9 AM UTC**, or trigger manually:

1. Go to GitHub → Actions → "Sync Email Stats from Kit to Notion"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Check Notion - Open Rate, Click Rate, Recipients, Total Opens, Total Clicks updated!

---

## Automation Schedule

| Workflow | Schedule | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Send Emails | Daily 8:00 AM UTC | Checks for "Ready to Send" emails and schedules them in Kit |
| Sync Stats | Daily 9:00 AM UTC | Updates email performance metrics from Kit to Notion |

**Both workflows** also have manual trigger buttons for on-demand execution.

---

## Safety Features

### 🔒 Past Date Protection

**Automatic protection against sending old emails:**
- Emails with past Publish Dates are automatically skipped
- Prevents accidentally sending dozens of old "Ready to Send" emails
- Shows clear warning in logs with instructions

**Example log:**
```
⏭️  SKIPPED: Email 'Old Newsletter' has past Publish Date (2024-08-30)
    Current time: 2025-10-29T08:00:00+00:00
    To send this email, update its Publish Date to a future date
```

### 🧪 Test Mode

**Send all emails only to your test email:**
- Override all segment settings
- Perfect for testing without risking production sends
- Enable: Set `TEST_MODE=true` in GitHub Secrets
- Disable: Set `TEST_MODE=false`

**When Test Mode is active:**
```
🔒 TEST MODE ENABLED - All emails will be sent ONLY to: your@email.com
    Set TEST_MODE=false to disable test mode
```

### 📊 Smart Segment Mapping

**Automatically finds Kit tags/segments by name:**
- Notion segment "Test" → Finds Kit segment/tag "Test"
- Notion segment "Everyone" or empty → Sends to all subscribers
- Any custom segment name → Searches Kit for matching tag/segment
- If not found → Logs warning and skips email

**See [SAFETY-CHECKS.md](SAFETY-CHECKS.md) for complete list of protections and potential issues.**

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending

**Check:**
- ✅ E-mail Status = "Ready to Send" (not Draft!)
- ✅ Publish Date is set AND in the future
- ✅ SL1 or Name is filled (subject line)
- ✅ Email has content blocks
- ✅ GitHub Secrets are configured correctly
- ✅ If using segments, verify they exist in Kit

**View Logs:**
- GitHub → Actions → Click on workflow run → View logs
- Download artifact "email-sender-logs" for detailed logs

---

### Stats Not Syncing

**Check:**
- ✅ Email has Kit Broadcast ID (was sent successfully)
- ✅ Broadcast ID is valid in Kit dashboard
- ✅ GitHub Secrets for NOTION_TOKEN and KIT_API_KEY are correct

**Note:** Stats may take a few hours to populate in Kit after sending.

---

### Images Not Showing

**Check:**
- ✅ Cloudinary credentials are correct
- ✅ Images in Notion are uploaded (not external links that expired)
- ✅ Check email_sender.log for Cloudinary upload errors

## Files Overview

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `send_emails_notion_to_kit.py` | Main script: Notion → Kit email sending |
| `sync_email_stats_kit_to_notion.py` | Stats sync: Kit → Notion metrics |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `.github/workflows/send-emails.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow for sending |
| `.github/workflows/sync-email-stats.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow for stats |

---

## Subject Line Logic

**Priority:**
1. Use **SL1** if filled
2. Fall back to **Name** if SL1 is empty
3. **SL2** is ignored (keep for your notes/future use)

**Example:**
- Name: "Day 3 - Productivity Tips"
- SL1: "The Secret to 10x Productivity"
- Email sends with subject: **"The Secret to 10x Productivity"**

---

## Segments Logic

| Segment in Notion | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **TEST_MODE=true** | Overrides all settings - sends ONLY to TEST_EMAIL |
| **Everyone** (or empty) | Sends to all subscribers |
| **Test** | Finds Kit segment/tag named "Test" |
| **Any custom name** | Searches Kit for matching segment/tag by name |

**Examples:**
- Notion segment "Premium Users" → Searches Kit for tag/segment "Premium Users"
- If not found in Kit → Logs warning and skips email
- Segment names are case-insensitive

---

## Cost

**100% FREE for moderate usage:**
- GitHub Actions: 2,000 minutes/month free
- Cloudinary: 25GB storage + 25GB bandwidth/month free
- Kit: Depends on your plan (API is included)
- Notion: Your existing plan

**This automation uses ~2 minutes/day = 60 minutes/month (well under free tier!)**

---

## Client Deployment

To set this up for a client:

1. **Share this README** with them
2. **They need to:**
   - Create their Notion database (or use template)
   - Get their own API keys (Notion, Kit, Cloudinary)
   - Fork your GitHub repo (or create their own)
   - Add GitHub Secrets
   - Done!

**Total setup time: 15-20 minutes**

---

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check troubleshooting section above
2. Review GitHub Actions logs
3. Verify all secrets are configured correctly
4. Ensure Notion database has all required properties

---

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions (not implemented yet):
- UTM tracking for revenue attribution
- A/B testing with SL2
- Segment-based sending (beyond Test/Everyone)
- Email templates/styles
- Scheduling queue dashboard
